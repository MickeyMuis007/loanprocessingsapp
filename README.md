# Loan Processing app

This is a loan processing application that allow user to request a loan. This app works with three different types of loans:

  - Home Loan
  - Car Loan
  - Instant Loan

Each loan have different interest rates and limits.

There are two types of customers. A member or non member. A member would get more benefits than non members, such as interest rates per loan reduction ect. Also there are user involved in the system which is the consultant. They would be those who the customer interact with to process a loan. The consultant is only authorized to process the loans after it has gone through a security check. Then you also get the manager that is allowed to work on the app. He have more authority than the consultant on the system. They are also allowed to process loans, they have access to all reports also manages the consultants on the app ect.

The customers go through a security check which will check for which loan they are qaulifying for after checking the clients needed details to processes the loans. Consultants cannot approve a loan if the customer have not gone through a security check which checks the loan the are approved to get.

We also keep track to which branch the user belongs to and have three different branches. Thats is as follows:
    
    -Head Office
    -Goodwood
    -Cape Town 
    
The system produces three different reports:
    
    -Invoice which would which is printed for the Customers use
    -A daily report that will keep track of all daily transaction that as taken place
    -A monthly report that keeps track of the whole months transaction and processes that took place
